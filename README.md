# Tom Canham - Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, technical skills, and contributions to the software development community.

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a software engineer with expertise in Python, automation, and system integration. I enjoy building practical tools that solve real-world problems and enhance developer productivity.

## üìÇ Featured Projects

### üéµ [Intelligent Music Agent](https://github.com/tomcanham/intelligent-music-agent)
**Technologies**: Python, Spotify API, OAuth, SQLite, AppleScript, Unix Sockets, Natural Language Processing

A sophisticated music management system with AI-powered analysis, natural language commands, and comprehensive Spotify integration. Features include:
- **Smart Shuffle**: Intelligent shuffle for liked songs and custom playlists with auto-daemon startup
- **Natural Language Processing**: Conversational commands like "shuffle liked songs" or "play some mellow music"
- **Advanced OAuth Integration**: Full Spotify API access with secure credential management
- **Intelligent Auto-Tagging**: Automatic genre, mood, and energy classification with fuzzy matching
- **Lyric-Based Discovery**: Find songs by remembering just fragments of lyrics
- **Reactive Intelligence**: Automatically learns from listening habits with real-time sync
- **Playlist Management**: Local sync and intelligent playback of all Spotify playlists
- **Daemon Architecture**: Background service with Unix socket IPC and threaded polling
- **Comprehensive CLI**: Professional command-line interface with auto-completion

*This project showcases advanced system architecture, API integration, natural language processing, background services, security best practices, and user experience design.*

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Projects
