# Tom Canham - Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my software engineering portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, technical skills, and contributions to the software development community.

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a software engineer with expertise in Python, automation, and system integration. I enjoy building practical tools that solve real-world problems and enhance developer productivity.

## üìÇ Featured Projects

### üéµ [Music Agent with Reactive Polling](https://github.com/tomcanham/music-agent)
**Technologies**: Python, Spotify API, SQLite, AppleScript, Unix Sockets

A comprehensive music agent that automatically analyzes and tags your music as you listen. Features include:
- **Reactive Polling**: Automatically detects track changes and analyzes new music
- **Auto-tagging**: Intelligent genre and mood classification using Spotify's API
- **Fuzzy Search**: Find songs with partial titles, lyrics, or artist names
- **Background Daemon**: Runs as a service with Unix socket communication
- **Local Database**: SQLite storage for preferences, history, and tags

*This project demonstrates system architecture design, API integration, background processing, and real-time data analysis.*
